                    The Kashmiri kahwah is made by boiling green tea leaves with
                    local saffron, cinnamon, cardamom and occasionally Kashmiri
                    roses. It is generally served with sugar or honey and
                    crushed nuts, usually almonds or walnuts. Some varieties are
                    made as a herbal infusion only—without the green tea
                    leaves.

                    Traditionally, kahwah is prepared in a copper kettle known
                    as a samavar. A samovar, which originates from Russia,
                    consists of a fire container, in which live coals are placed
                    to keep the tea warm. Around the fire container there is a
                    space for water to boil and the tea leaves and other
                    ingredients are mixed with the water.

                    While its exact origins are unclear, kahwah tea leaves are
                    said to have come to Kashmir through the Spice Route (which
                    Kashmir was a central point of). Many believe that it
                    originated during the Kushan empire in the first and second

                    The word Kahwah in Kashmiri means "sweetened tea", the word
                    also seems to be related to the Turkish word for coffee
                    (kahveh) which in turn might be derived from the Arabic word
