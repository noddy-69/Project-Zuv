                The kitchen is cleansed, and utensils are washed thoroughly for
                the preparation. The fish is usually prepared with Nadru (lotus

                offered in a Toke (an earthen deep dish) and kept in the Kanī
                (attic of the house – the topmost floor just below the roof). In
                addition to the cooked rice and fish, raw fish is also kept in a
                ring of grass called chret along with a glass or a small bowl of
                water. This offering is either kept covered under Kranjul or

                Kchechmaavas is celebrated in the Hindu calendar month of Paush

                symbol of staying in harmony with other beings surrounding you.
                The belief goes that when humans first settled in Kashmir, the
                land of Yaksha, they had an agreement or a pact that the humans
                would offer food to Yaksha on cold freezing night of wintry
                months so that the Yaksha would not cause any trouble to
                humans.

                As per the legends and myths, when the humans settled in the
                land of the Yakshas there was a mutual undertaking-a sort of
                treaty-that on certain fixed occasions in the cold freezing
                wintry months, the humans would offer a sumptuous non-vegetarian
                feast to the Yakshas who in turn would not trouble them. Yakshas
                by nature were believed less ferocious but more powerful with
                divine inclinations.

                which is kept at the compound wall or outside the house. The
                kitchen stone mortal (kajwath) is placed, by the side, on a
                circular base (ring made out of hay), and worshiped as a symbol
                of the cosmos and decorated with sindoor (vermilion), sandal
                paste, raw rice and flowers. Some households also serve fish on
                this day. Some believe this is also the worship of Kubera.

                      his life and glory by finding wheat grains, washing them,

                      of course freed him from the well and restored his place
                      as king.  The purpose of the story and puja is that by
                      performing it on this day, preparing sweet bread and
                      offering the same to the deity, the poverty and the
